# Tic-Tac-Toe-1
Will be changing some of the aspects like X and O, and will be trying to use other symbols for the game

The basic Tic-Tac-Toe game consists of two players, X, O, who takes turn making the spaces in a 3 by 3 gird (as shown below). But for this project we will not use X, O instead we will be trying to use to other things like other alphabets, signs, or emojiâ€™s.  We are just trying to give it a twist and make something new out of it.
